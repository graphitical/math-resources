* [Integer sequences](https://oeis.org/)

# Documents
* [Useful inequalities](documents/ineq.pdf)
* [Matrix Algebra Cookbook](documents/matrixcookbook.pdf)

# Ideas
* Use complex numbers when doing simple 2D vector math. It simplifies rotations and scaling of vectors.

# Mental Math and Simplifications
* $\phi \approx 1.618034$ and 1 mile $\approx$ 1.609344, so miles to km conversions can use the Fibonacci sequence. 130 km/hr $\approx$ 80 mph
* 1 lightnanosecond $\approx$ 1 foot
* $2^10 \approx 10^3$ for making powers of 2 easier
* $1-x \leq e^{-x}$
